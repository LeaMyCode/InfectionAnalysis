# Infection Analysis
With the help of the code you can determine the number of cells within the image using the DAPI channel and the number of infected cells using the virus-specific (nucleoprotein)-stained channel. The channels are binarized utilizing the OpenCV library (version 4.8.1.78) with dynamic thresholding and the cell nuclei channel was prior processed 
with a Gaussian blur filter using the cv2.GaussianBlur function. Additionally, the principle of finding sure for- and background of the cells or nucleoprotein staining was performed to improve the thresholding (Bhattiprolu, 2020). Afterwards, segmentation was performed using watershed 
segmentation. The czifile library (version 2019.7.2) was used for image handling, data handling was performed using pandas (version 2.1.4) and NumPy was used for data processing (version 1.26.2).
